# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
As a student using this Prework Study Guide, I want to clearly understand what this guide is about so I can use it correctly. I built this project to incorporate the three cornerstone languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS. This project will be used for my reference and experience. I have learned that my challenges are opportunities to become a better coder.
